## Our Aim:

 To create a database for teams in the IPL containing a list of players and teams and their stats, coupled with records created by the players.



## Our Team:

## Our Parts:


### MSG:-

  I will be using MySQL to create a database which will contain the tables to be used for our project. I will also be coordinating with ***VVP*** to keep the database up to date.   The tables I will create are:
  
  1. allplayers: The table containing player names with their information
  2. teamstats: The table containing team names and their information
  3. playerrecords: The table containing player names along with the records they have made


### VVP:-

  I will be using Python to create the base code which will be used for our project. It will help us link the database with python. I will also be creating functions that will     be later implemented in Tkinter by **MN** and **DSR**. The functions I will create are:
  
  1. Displaying records from each of the tables
  2. Adding, Deleting and Updating Records from each of the tables
  3. Searching for players, records or teams and displaying their information


### MN:-

  I will be using Tkinter to interact with the raw python and create functions for the user.
  
  Using **VVP**'s Code, I will be creating a barebones window for each function.


### DSR:-

  I will be integrating **MN**'s Tkinter code into an aesthetically pleasing GUI for the user.
  
  I will also add a database restore point option, such that even if any data problems occur, the user can rest easy knowing that there is a save point.
  
  My code will be the final outcome of our project.
  
  I will also be creating a discord bot which will be able to retrieve player, team and record information to display it in the form of an interactive message.
